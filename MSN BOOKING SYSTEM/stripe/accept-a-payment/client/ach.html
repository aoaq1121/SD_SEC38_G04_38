          By clicking Accept, you authorize {TODO: YOUR BUSINESS NAME HERE} to
          debit the bank account specified above for any amount owed for
          charges arising from your use of {TODO} services and/or
          purchase of products from {TODO}, pursuant to {TODO}sâ€™
          website and terms, until this authorization is revoked. You may amend
          or cancel this authorization at any time by providing notice to
          {TODO} with 30 (thirty) days notice.

          If you use {TODO} services or purchase additional products
