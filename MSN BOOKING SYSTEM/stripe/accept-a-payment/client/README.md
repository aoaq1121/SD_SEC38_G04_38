# Accept a payment examples in HTML/JS

## How to run locally

This is the HTML client for the sample and runs independently of the server.
To start the backend servers, choose from a list of several servers available
in the sibling `../server` directory. Running a backend server is a requirement
and a dependency for this HTML front-end to work. See the README in the root
of the project for more details.

To run the HTML client locally:

1. Start the app

```sh
npx serve -p 3000
```

This will start the HTML server running on localhost:3000.
